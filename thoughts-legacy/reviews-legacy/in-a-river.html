              <h1>In a River</h1>
              <h2>Rostam</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Every time I listen to Rostam’s “In a River” I think to myself that I want to get married to this song. It’s funny that such a song should open with lyrics as icky as “slide into the cold mud.” But it does. From this opening line Rostam weaves together a beautiful story about skinny dipping “in a river / in the dark.”</p>

            <p>The lyrics describe a deeply intimate relationship “we’ve got dreams we share to together, we’ve got time to spend oh hell yea,” but not one that is explicitly sexual. He and the boy are swimming, not naked, but “with no clothes on.” They’re “holding onto” one another, not caressing or cuddling. Queerness here is entangled with romance and intimacy, but divorced from explicit sexuality.</p>

            <p>The story of skinny dipping is buoyed by the ebb and flow of a cello, accentuating melodically the natural movements of the river. Given Rostam’s background as a queer, first-generation, Iranian American its no surprise that his music collapses traditional boundaries of genre and style. That genre-bending work is on full display when the cello shading gives way to a fiddle-laden square dance, which in turn gives way to an EDM base synth, and ultimately, to the vibrant timbre of Rostam’s voice a cappella.</p>

            <p>The song effortlessly spans styles, genres, and time periods, giving the narrative a timeless quality and divorcing it from reality. The two boys skinny dipping together could  be high schoolers, college students, or married men. Hiding “underneath the pines” they exist only in connection with one another, divorced from the world around them. The song ends with the boys lying on the river bank where “everything is warm.” They’re hiding from reality, but watching it from a distance as they bask “in the faint light / of the head lights / of passing cars.”</p>

            <p>Aside from the very explicit use of the word “boy” to describe Rostam’s partner, the song bears no notice of being gay. The intimate romance between the two men exists on its own, not completely separate from the rest of the world (the straight world), but distinctly adjacent to it. It’s a timeless love story that just happens to be gay. In this way it interweaves queerness into traditional notions of love and romance, while simultaneously reclaiming queer romance from many of the sociopolitical realities that constrain queer relationships.</p>

            <p>The song celebrates gay relationships on their own terms. The river is a place for only these two men, these two boys, to play, to dream, and to love one another free from the constraints of the outside world. Sliding into the cold mud is itself a form of escapism, a way to explore oneself and one’s identities free from society. But much like a wedding, it is also a celebration of the intimate world these two men are building together.</p>
