              <h1>Miss Anthropocene</h1>
              <h2>Grimes</h2>
            </div> 
            <p> “This is the sound of the end of the world,” Grimes declares with an understated defiance. Her voice is distorted and saturated, dripping with a lustful melancholy as she evokes climate change, economic collapse, and the technological singularity. In <i>Miss Anthropocene</i> Grimes has delivered a soundtrack for the end times. Equal parts genre-bending, auteur and jaded iconoclast, Grimes tackles the mores of the moment and the anguish of a generation in her first album as a bona-fide pop star.</p>

            <p>The original concept for this album centered on an "anthropomorphic goddess of climate change" in which "each song [would] be a different embodiment of human extinction." While that concept was not fully realized, climate change remains a consistent motif, as do issues of political power more generally, and the insipid spread of technology. An eerie, existential bass underlies most of the album, echoing the anxiety and listlessness of generation experiencing climate disaster, endless war, unprecedented inequality, and now a literal pandemic.</p> 

            <p>In the aptly named “We Appreciate Power,” Grimes takes aim at the people and institutions causing such anxiety. Distorted guitars abound as she shrieks in the distance and offers twisted political aphorisms. “Pledge allegiance to the world’s most powerful computer,” coos Grimes, channeling a steam-punk Lana Del Rey. Her rage against the powers that be is most visceral in a feature from 潘PAN. The Chinese artists raps with an instinctual fury over an ethereal, crackling bass in “Darkside.” “Unrest is on our soul / we don’t move our bodies anymore” Grimes whispers, presciently evoking the pandemic and the atmosphere of quarantine.</p> 

            <p>In the past, Grimes’ ethereal, bubble-gum pop pastiche was a welcome reprieve from the monotonous contentment of most pop music. On <i>Miss Anthropocene</i> the satirical cheerleader pop is shed in favor of a dystopian, industrial sound that feels less like an escape than a reflection of reality. The acoustic number “Delete Forever” is the album’s most traditional ‘pop’ song, but even its shimmering production is just a façade for the decidedly despondent message.  “Lying so awake, things I can't escape / Lately, I just turn 'em into demons,” recounts a vulnerable Grimes, channeling a gloomy Natasha Bedingfield as she comments on the opioid epidemic. “Flew into the sun, fucking heroin / Lately, I just turn 'em into reasons and excuses.”</p>

            <p>Throughout the album Grimes intertwines personal, emotional trauma with her broader critiques of society. The slow burning rock number “You’ll Miss Me When I’m not Around” is equal parts break-up anthem and climate change warning. Deep bass reverbs and a steady kick drum set the score for angsty musings “I promise if I make it / You’ll see me underground / You’ll miss me when I’m not around”. In “4 ÆM” critters whisper in your ear like a DMT trip, while Grimes whisks you through the emotional tumult of an early morning booty call. The entire experience is wrapped in ghostly, tropical synths and moody, drawn out vocalizations.</p>

            <p>The album’s electronic, futuristic production wraps Grimes’s naturalist, counterculture message in a rich post-ironic irony. She warns that capitalism and technology are fueling the climate apocalypse, but as the end of the world beckons, Grimes invites us to drown our sorrows at one final pyrotechnic, laser light show. On <i>Miss Anthropocene</i> Grimes may have arrived as a true pop star, but through her bold concept and trademark ethereal production, she leaves as a something larger.</p>

            <p>It may be the end of the world, but it’s never sounded so good.</p>
