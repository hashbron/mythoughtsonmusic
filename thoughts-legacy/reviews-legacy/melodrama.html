              <h1>Melodrama</h1>
              <h2>Lorde</h2>
            </div>
            <p> There is a rich, fluorescent, brooding sensation that pulses through 20 year old Ella Yelich-O’Connor's latest record, <i>Melodrama</i>. Ella, better known by her now iconic stage name, Lorde, takes us through the rapturous journey of being a teenager, and being in love, and being out of it, and all of the moments in between.</p>

            <p>The record's opening number, the simultaneously exhilarating and cautionary "Greenlight," is a synthy-pop banger overlaid with a grungy helicopter-like chop and Lorde’s uniquely inquizitive lyrics. “Thought you said that you would always be in love / but you're not in love no more,” she quips to a former lover before returning to her party “on the light-up floor.” The album’s first single missed its titular opportunity for a Great Gatsby reference, but the absence of Gatsby almost punctuates the fleeting nature of Lorde’s teenage love story.</p>

            <p>Lorde’s love is not as crippling and consuming as Gatsby’s. “Our love is a ghost / Well I guess I should go / Yeah I guess I should go,” she muses in "Hard Feelings," in between mechanical synths. At the same time, Lorde makes clear that her teenage love is not altogether meaningless either. “I’m a little much for everyone / they’re gonna watch me disappear into the sun” Lorde extols as she ponders what went wrong, in the dramatically mellow, "Liability."</p>
            
            <p>Which brings us to the album’s titular track: "Melodrama" (it’s actually called "Sober II (Melodrama)"). With a deliciously smooth tour of her lower register that evokes her last album’s "Tennis Court," Lorde dismisses the frivolity of teenage romance “we told you this was melodrama,” and then immediately acknowledges her longing for it “our only wish is melodrama.” Lorde’s unique lyrical complexity (she brilliantly, and terrifyingly, rhymes terror with horror) allows her to both praise and condemn the intricacies of being a young woman.</p> 
            
            <p>This complicated relationship with female adolescence is the energy that pulses through the entire album. In "Supercut" Lorde takes us on a whirlwind young romance with Taylor-swift esque talk-singing “I’ll be your quiet afternoon crush / make you crazy over my touch.” She then bemoans the deliciousness of their relationship on "Writer in the Dark." “Sorry I was never good like you,” she purrs, letting her lover go.</p>
            
            <p>The album’s final track "Perfect Places" brings everything full circle, with an electro-pop score that evokes back to "Greenlight," and a stereo-induced sing-song chorus that explodes with adolescent ebullience. “Every night, I live and die,” she opens, acknowledging the dichotomy of the adolescent experience. In her chorus, Lorde pairs the line “All of the things we’re taking,” a half-brag about youthful substance abuse, with “all of our hero’s fading,” an acknowledgement of the realities of growing up. These two lines, the first embracing teenage frivolity, and the second acknowledging a necessary jadedness, epitomize the song, and the entire album’s tug-of-war: society regards young women at their peak for beauty, sex, and their cultural cachet, yet at a trough for their perspectives, their experiences, or their opinions. The song’s production highlights the former with a slick, bass-heavy, beat, and an aggressively overdubbed chorus that calls to the listener “let’s go to perfect places.” This is all well and good until the end of the song when the bass gives way to an electro-synth that gives way to a simple grand piano, and Lorde declares with her final line of the song, and her final line of the album, “What the fuck are perfect places anyway?”</p>
