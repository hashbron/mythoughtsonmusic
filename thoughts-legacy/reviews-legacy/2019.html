              <h1>2019</h1>
              <h2>Lucy Dacus</h2>
            </div> 
            <p>In 2018 Lucy Dacus released the critically acclaimed album <i>Historian</i> and formed the indie trio boygenius with Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers releasing their well-received self-titled debut EP. In 2019 Dacus cemented herself as a staple of contemporary indie, riding high off the success of both of last year’s releases and opening on tour for the indomitable Mitski. Needless to say, 2019 was a big year for Dacus. Her latest release, 2019, charts her experiences, both personal and political, throughout the year.</p>

            <p>The EP’s first single, a rollicking, upbeat cover of “La Vie En Rose,” was released on Valentine’s day 2019, part of a planned series of Holiday themed releases. Dacus’s full bodied voice gives a cathartic performance with understated rock production. The holiday singles continued with a Halloween inspired cover of Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight” and an electric guitar addled take on Wham’s “Last Christmas.” The former languishes in spooky synths and a distorted vocal production while the latter finds Dacus whisper singing with a vengeance. “Now I know what a fool I’ve been / but if you kiss me now you’ll fool me again,” she whispers, her voice dripping with a jaded, cool, indifference.</p>

            <p>Dacus’s best cover is undoubtedly her take on Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark.” She speeds up the American classic with a rollicking bass guitar and Springsteen’s infectious drum line. Her strident voice rides confidently over the reverb of dueling electric guitars.</p>

            <p><i>2019</i> also features a number of original songs. “Forever Half Mast” feels like Dacus’s attempt to write a Casey Musgrave’s song. “America the tried and true / red and white and black and blue,” Dacus swoons over a simple melody with just a touch of twang. The lyrics touch on the political with a reluctant, at times sardonic, patriotism. The song devolves into a Mitski-esque distorted guitar, with a muffled, overdubbed Dacus warning “all for one and one for all / nobody escapes the fall.” On “My Mother and I” Dacus grasps at intimacy with a beautiful, though vacuous, number. Her voice piercing through a wistful acoustic fiddling, she opens up about body image and her relationship with her mother “My mother hates her body / we share the same outline / she swears that she loves mine.”</p>

            <p>The strongest original offering is “Fool’s Gold,” the first song on the EP.  Both a somber reflection on adolescent modernity, and a detached musing about contemporary politics, this number dangles delicate lyrics reflections over a wistful acoustic melody. Her songwriting chops showcase an introspective apprehension that set the tone for the year to come “A new year begins it ushers us in / the knot in my gut is coming with.” The refrain is a beautiful, evolving list of who is blaming what. “He’ll blame the alcohol and you’ll blame the full moon,” Dacus coos with a nod toward contemporary gender politics and the recent reentry of astrology into the zeitgeist. In the second chorus she engages more explicitly with electoral politics singing “She’ll blame the fall of man / and I’ll blame the evening news / for giving us Tuesday / and dropping the ball / building our feud like bricks in a wall.” She delicately invokes the President, his landmark wall, and the tense partisanship that have permeated the last few years. The impetus for the blame is never made explicit, but the alluring mystery points to contemporary social angst, economic uncertainty, and political tension. In the end, none of it really matters, as Dacus opines that it’s “all glittering fools gold.”</p>

            <p>A meandering collection of original offerings and disparate covers, <i>2019</i> feels less like a cohesive unit and more like a year-long diary. On her original offerings Dacus taps into national feelings of tension and unease while her covers indulge moments of celebration and festivity. At her best, she channels deeply personal experiences and connects them to broader, collective movements of the year. <i>2019</i>, much like its eponymous year, is a mixed bag. The EP rides emotional highs and lows; it offers new songs and revamps old ones; at times it is deeply resonant and at other times it misses the mark.</p>
