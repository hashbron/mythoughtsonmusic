              <h1>Sunset Season</h1>
              <h2>Conan Gray</h2>
            </div> 
            <p>In a recent interview with <i>Seventeen Magazine</i>, Conan Gray confesses, or perhaps brags, that he is a huge Taylor Swift fan. “The first YouTube video that I ever watched in my whole entire life was 'Teardrops On My Guitar' music video,” divulges <i>Billboard Magazine</i>’s Prince of Pop. Gray is young - younger, he notes, than Taylor Swift’s "22" - but despite his age, his debut EP <i>Sunset Season</i> is a surprisingly introspective ethnography of teenage suburbia.</p>

			<p>Throughout the EP, Gray explores the highs and lows of the adolescent experience, anguishing over young love, relishing juvenile frivolity, and bemoaning the boomers. High school romance serves as simple fodder for lyrics that grasp at nuanced introspection. At his best, Gray (aided by the prolific Joel Little) balances his anecdotes with striking relatability. At their worst, naive couplets showcase the banality of youth “I’ll admit that I sometimes maybe might / think about you at night.” All of this reverie is aided by gentle, pop-rock production. Synthy basses swoon behind well placed high-hats and stuttering copter chops.</p>

			<p>If you think this sounds like the description of a Lorde album, you’re absolutely right. Gray clearly takes queues from the New Zealand pop star, both sonically and thematically. His chorus are replete with overdubbed uptalk and he vacillates between ballad and banger with a deft touch. In “Idle Town,” a meandering ode to the doldrums of suburbia, Gray reflects on his high school experience over a delicate synth harmony. “We invent our own little games … We all promised that we wouldn’t stay,” he reflects. The refrain “curfews at midnight / we watch the sunrise,” looks to larger things to come with a melancholy zeal.</p>

			<p>Gray hits his stride, and his most Lorde-like moments, in the middle of the EP. “Generation Why,” the EP’s most political piece, is a swooning rumination on generational angst. Gray offers a jaded response to criticisms of the title’s eponymous generation and of his own, Gen-Z. His lyrics touch on everything from the “lazy millennial” stereotype to climate change. “Our word’s ending at noon / could we all just move to the moon?” he coos with a sardonic disdain. The message isn’t subtle, but the songs’s sleek production masks Gray’s earnestness in a swelling bass and a baroque harmony.</p>

			<p>Where he lacks Lorde’s succinct poignancy, Gray offers a younger juvenile authenticity. “Just let me be sad and lonely” he requests on “Crush Culture,” an infectious, danceable rejection of teenage obsession. Gray is young, naive, and inexperienced. His musings on love are limited to high school crushes and teenage understandings of intimacy, but he wraps such dense experiences in contagious tongue-twisting talk-sining “I don’t care what you’re saying / I don’t wanna participate / in your game of manipulation.” In the overdubbed chorus, reminiscent of Lorde’s “Tennis Court,” Gray relishes in his disgust declaring “Crush culture makes me wanna spill my guts out.”</p>

			<p>As a first EP, <i>Sunset Season</i> showcases Gray’s ability to meld a youthful earnestness with introspective exposition. There are moments of daft banality, but they are outshone by artful reflection and slick production. As Gray displays in his <i>Seventeen</i> interview, memorizing the lyrics to most every Taylor Swift song is an impressive feat. If he can continue to hone the contemplative catchiness of a more youthful Swift, it will be Gray’s lyrics we are memorizing for years to come.</p>
