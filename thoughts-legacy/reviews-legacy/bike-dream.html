              <h1>Bike Dream</h1>
              <h2>Rostam</h2>
            </div>
            <p>"Bike Dream" is a gay pop song. The rollicking, cyclical baseline is composed of layered synths and an infectious high hat. A deep resounding bass gives the song an instantly danceable beat. Rostam’s lyrics nauseatingly string together the ups and downs of relationships like he’s biking through the city. His auto-tuned narration asks the listener to hop on the handle bars and join him for the ride.</p>

            <p>In the song’s chorus Rostam coos about the two boys in his life: “One to kiss your neck / and one to bring you breakfast … One to love you sweetly / One does so discreetly.” The dichotomy collapses and it becomes clear he’s singing about the same boy. He’s riding high through the bliss of intimacy and the passion of lust. The word “discreetly” - with its obvious connotations for a gay man - makes clear that he is also riding the lows of queer dating in a straight world.</p>

            <p>The song’s real dichotomy is between its lyrics and its production. The electro-pop beat is befitting of top-40 pop and a Kygo remix would be par for the course at any club. But the song’s lyrics delve into queer introspection. Sure all the classic themes of pop are there: sex ("You’re sore / from the night before / from knocking at my door”), drugs (“Content to smoke there on the chair"), and the like - but so too are Rostam’s complicated experiences with his identity.</p>

            <p>Rostam reflects on gay dating through a series of couplets about past relationships. “Before I leave I want to try to go back in time / To just that moment in my life where I should have spoke up but I lied,” he muses on a moment in the closet. “Put in the state, my lips and eyes give me away / And now there’s nothing, I can say no,” he reflects on an unintentional moment of coming out. There’s a poetic subtlety to all of his couplets. They are as much about what he isn’t saying as they are about the words he sings. “As I sat there with my jaw open and I smiled / He pulled his sweater off and tried to explain he'd all but given up on love.”</p>

            <p>Many of the couplets are accompanied by the refrain “I pulled away I see another of myself / who’s found true love and happiness.” Rostam repeats this out of body experience of wondering what could have been. Much like the universality of pop music, asking what could have been is a more or less universal experience in relationships. In "Bike Dream" Rostam interweaves these universal themes with stories about coming out and struggling with identity.</p>

            <p>Like so many pop songs, "Bike Dream" is about relationships. It’s synth-laden, base heavy, banger about finding love, loosing love, and all the loves you may never know. "Bike Dream" chronicles Rostam’s experiences with many boys, but never settles on the one. Finding him is still a pipe dream.</p>
