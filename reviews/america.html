      <h1>America</h1>
      <h2>Sufjan Stevens</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>In 2003, a little-known indie artist with a silent j in his name announced a project to make 50 concept albums, one inspired by each of the United States. His first album dropped that same year, <i>Michigan</i>, named after and inspired by his home state. Sufjan Steven’s Fifty State Project stopped after just two states, but his latest release, the first single off his upcoming album, <i>The Ascension</i>, plays like a spiritual, if not literal, completion of the project.</p>

    <p>Aptly named "America," the single runs over twelve minutes long, spending that time meandering through different production styles: ethereal synths swell and crackle, Stevens’ coos in an overdubbed voice, acoustic strummings are looped ad infinitum. The piece sounds of vastness; the swirling tour of styles adds an epic quality and evokes the grand ambition of the fifty-album concept.</p>

    <p>Stevens’ lyrics, meanwhile, paint a bleak tale of disillusion. (“Don’t do to me what you did to America / Don’t do to me what you did to yourself.”) His voice echoes over the techno pulse of a heartbeat monitor. Something has died. Notably, the track was released on July 3rd, marking the beginning of the Independence Day Weekend. As families across the country gathered to watch <i>Hamilton</i> on Disney Plus, Stevens stopped to access his politics. (“I have loved you, like a dream / I have worshipped, I believed.”) Amidst the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests and the coronavirus pandemic, Sufjan grapples with the current state of the world and his failure to rationalize it. (“I’m ashamed to admit, I no longer believe.”) </p>

    <p>Whether he ever believed, and how much, is up for debate (Stevens did, after all, admit that the Fifty State Project was a “marketing gimmick”) but  the track nevertheless finishes on a hopeful note, though cautiously so: an eerie symphony swells into a resurgent, almost angelic harmony, then dims as ringing church bells fade to oblivion. Stevens’ final lyrics harken to a more ideal vision of America. (“I am fortune, I am free / I’m like a fever of light in the land of opportunity.”) There is a redemptive quality to the track’s conclusion, a vision of what America could be, of 50 states intertwined in a great unfinished project - or as Alexander Hamilton might put it, “America you great unfinished symphony.”</p>
