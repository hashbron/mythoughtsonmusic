      <h1>Gaslighter</h1>
      <h2>Dixie Chicks</h2>
    </div> 

    <p> After nearly a decade since their last album, the Dixie Chicks are back with the rocking country-pop banger "Gaslighter." The song loosely recounts the experiences leading up to and during lead singer Natalie Maines’ divorce. “We moved to California and we followed your dreams / I believed in the promises you made to me,” she barrels over delightful, danceable strumming, foretelling future conflict. Much like their 2006 hit "Not Ready to Make Nice" about the violent backlash they faced for criticizing President Bush, the Dixie Chicks find a way to make the deeply, intimately personal, broadly relatable.<p>

    <p>The number’s production is simple with a twangy acoustic harmony buoying the trio’s rich voices. A symbol and kick drum join the acoustics, punctuating Maines’ story telling and building to a head bopping chorus that turns the title into an infectious refrain. “Gaslighter / Big timer / Repeating all of the mistakes of your father,” the trio harmonizes in a painful reflection “Gaslighter / you broke me / you’re sorry but where’s my apology?”<p>

    <p>The notion of being gaslit, and especially the gendered connotations of the song, tap into this moment’s zeitgeist. With the #MeToo movement now a few years old and a record number of female candidates pursuing elected office, the Dixie Chicks drive home a political as well as personal message about the powerful role of men. “You think it’s justifiable I think it’s pretty cruel / and you know you lie best when you lie to you,” Maines croons with a fervent, scorned, twang.<p>

    <p>I cannot imagine Elizabeth Warren dropping out without having this song to comfort me - and thankfully I’ll never have to.</p>
