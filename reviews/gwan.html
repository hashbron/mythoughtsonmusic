        <h1>Gwan</h1>
        <h2>Rostam</h2>
      </div>
      <p>"Gwan" is a song about dreams. Rostam ponders his dreams about the future, reflects on nightmares from the past, and muses on the daydreams of today.</p>

      <p>Rostam sings with a muddled a voice, a slurryiness to his words. There’s an ethereal quality to his slurs as they float over the crisp precision of a zigzagging violin motif. Subtle accents from a piano and bass drum brilliantly create a feeling of the empyrean. This song exists in the ethereal world, separate from the reality we occupy.</p>

      <p>Rostam’s uses this distinction - between the song’s reality and our own - to showcase his existential musings. His questioning takes on universal themes of belonging and introspection, but in the context of his queer identity, such musings take on new meaning. “Do you ever get the sense / you’re watching someone else?” he wonders. “Some people say they know, they never really know.” he opines.</p>

      <p>The song’s refrain showcases Rostam’s queer introspection. “All of these dreams keep coming back to me slowly,” Rostam slurs as if having just awoken. “And sometimes I laugh, when I think about how you know me,” he adds, alluding to some other person, perhaps a close friend or a lover. Vagaries abound in this line, only strengthening the surreal nature of the song. Is Rostam laughing because of how close he is to this person? Or because of some unbreachable distance? Again, his words explore feelings that can be universal, but are especially salient in a queer context.</p>

      <p>“I think about how you know me,” is a reflection on coming out, a life long process that exists in various stages with different people. It is simultaneously a joyful thought about the closeness he shares to those who know him, and a somber allusion to those people in his life who don’t. “Sometimes I laugh,” references the same dichotomy serving as both an ebullient celebration and a cautious coping mechanism.</p>

      <p>All of Rostam’s eclectic ruminations, some more explicitly queer than others, are unified by the heavenly production. His production co-opts the musical language of Christianity to question his own reality. "Gwan"’s arrangement could easily be that of a church hymn set to a pipe organ. In using such unmistakably religious stylings, Rostam reclaims ideas of spirituality and the divine for a queer listener. The Christian allusions reach a zenith in the songs bridge where the crisp violin fades and is replaced by a drawn out cello. Buffeted by an angelic chorus, Rostam recounts his final dream: </p>

      <p>“And when I woke up from that dream / I was sleeping in a basement / leaves were falling on the pavement / I was happy in the city. / Took a friend’s car to the ocean / Are you ready? / Are you ready?”</p>
