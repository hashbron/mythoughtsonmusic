      <h1>Love Story (Taylor's Version)</h1>
      <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>There’s an immediate familiarity to Taylor Swift’s re-recording of <i>Love Story</i>. The track opens with a knowing acoustic riff that is immediately over shadowed by her iconic opening line: “we were both young when I first saw you.” Swift’s words, rendered with a gentle defiance, echo through the last 13 years of Swiftian lore, reaching back before all of drama, before Scooter Braun and Kanye West, before countless boyfriends and break ups.</p>

    <p>The last decade and half has been quite a ride for Swift, taking her from poetic country darling, to the height of fame as an international girl-squad superstar. She was dragged through the mud before adopting an ugly, woman-scorned persona, only to return from a deep retreat to the woods as a cottage core icon. Always a storyteller, Swift’s newest effort to re-record her entire discography can be seen as an attempt to rewrite those years; she’s taking the narrative back from the Scooter Braun’s and Kanye West’s of the world, ignoring the media critics and stepping into her own.</p>

    <p>Such an effort is daunting, especially given her 8-album catalogue, and many other artists would crumble under the sheer weight of it’s ambition (we're still waiting on 48 state albums, Sufjan). But on this first re-release Swift has made it feel effortless, even familiar. Listening to <i>Love Story (Taylor’s Version)</i>, just as single as you were in middle school, and somehow still in your childhood bedroom, draws up much of the same twinkling magic now as it did then.</p>

    <p>The new record itself doesn’t stray much from its source material. Save for some moderate toying with the production - the acoustics are pulled back to a “Red” like simplicity for the verses while the well known chorus feels untouched - Swift has more or less recreated the original.</p>

    <p>But there is something new at play. It’s seeing Swift’s name as the singer, writer, producer, and owner. It’s the defiance of her reasserting herself. It’s the knowledge that she is finally free.</p>

    <p>In the Folklore/Evermore era many critics wrote that Swift was finally releasing the kind of music she always wanted to make. I never quite agreed with this claim - I can’t see an artists as deliberate and methodical as Swift making something she didn’t want to - but I do think her old records were made under certain constraints. At least since “Red” every Taylor Swift album has been conceived with an international tour in mind. Songs were designed to fill stadiums; albums were packaged with merchandise and exclusive liner notes. When the pandemic freed Swift from those constraints, she turned inward, doubling down on her strengths as a story teller. The twangy intimacy of <i>Betty</i> could never fill a stadium like the booming synthesizers of <i>Blank Space</i>, but for once, it didn’t have to. Swift was making music for herself and herself alone.</p>

    <p>The latest version of Love Story brims with that same sense of self actualization. Even the title, <i>Love Story (Taylor’s Version)</i>, asserts her newfound ownership, over the financial and legal aspects of her work, sure, but also over the artistry. Swift is remaking her music - and herself - on her own terms. From the very first line of <i>Taylor’s Version</i> it feels like Swift is returning to her youth, as if she’s seeing herself and her music for the first time, and she’s falling in love all over again.</p>
