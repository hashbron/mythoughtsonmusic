      <h1>GINGER</h1>
      <h2>BROCKHAMPTON</h2>
    </div>
    <p>“Anyone heard of an album called <i>Saturation?</i>” Kevin Abstract asks with an ironic knowingness. The crowd erupts with cheers, everyone’s heard of <i>Saturation</i> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i>) and now they’re about to hear it live. Kevin’s question reminds the audience of the prolific BROCKHAMPTON's iconic trilogy, but it also reminds the audience that the <i>Saturation</i> trilogy is not the sole reason they’re here. This is a new BROCKHAMPTON - with new members, a new record label, and something new to prove.</p>

    <p>The minimalist sets of their previous tours are more or less intact. The only deviation is three crosses sitting atop the otherwise empty set. The overt Christian message is reminiscent of Kanye West and contrasts with startling un-religiosity of BROCKHAMPTON's music. For a band that has always been a group of misfits trying to fit in, their lyrics rarely turn to the lord for salvation. Each band member dressed in all black and neon orange overalls - a deviation from previous tours that saw band members sporting shirts with various slurs embroidered in all caps. N*GGER. F*GGOT. CR*CKER. But again, this is a new BROCKHAMPTON signed to a mass market record label and appealing to a mass market audience.</p>

    <p>Their new album, <i>GINGER</i>, was the focal piece of the night. Band members pranced around the stage to the cascading piano of "BOY BYE" and Joba led a the crowd in an a cappella introduction to "SUGAR." The earth shaking base of "IF YOU PRAY RIGHT" was accentuated with shots of smoke canons, the only use of pyrotechnics in their minimalist production. Most songs from <i>Ginger</i> were well received with the audience singing along - but the crowd cheered and jumped the most throughout the interspersed greatest hits of <i>SATURATION</i>. 

    <p>"GOLD" and "BLEACH" stole the show as the crowd sang along in near unison. “Keep a gold chain round my neck / Fly as a Jet / Boy better treat me with respect.” Bearface led the crowd in a group sway to "BLEACH"’s cathartic chorus. “Who got the feeling? tell me why I cry when I feel it, tell me why.” Even the lesser known "JUNKY" received some love as Abstract rapped the song’s, raw, introspective first verse.

    <p>It was in these moments that BROCKHAMPTON was at its strongest. When the band channeled their individual rage into a collective raw energy that infected the crowd. The <i>SATURATION</i> trilogy balanced this rawness with unorthodox production and powerful lyricism. The rage and energy on <i>GINGER</i> are still there, but oftentimes feel misguided and overproduced. 

    <p>The highlight of the night came unambiguously from "BOOGIE," the unflappable siren-addled banger off <i>Saturation III</i>. “What are the rules for breakfast today?” screamed Abstract as the crowd leaped to its feet. In their previous tour, the boy band opened with "BOOGIE", a dramatic entrance that said “we are BROCKHAMPTON, and we have something to say.” Now it’s their closer (before the encore), a reminder of what BROCKHAMPTON once was and still could be. </p>
