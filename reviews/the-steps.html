      <h1>The Steps</h1>
      <h2>Haim</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>Over a twangy classic rock groove Daniella Haim’s rich voice drips with frustration and disappointment as she coos to her baby, “I can’t understand why / you don’t understand me!” The lyrics are both simple and gut wrenching, and the groovy guitar riffs would make Fleetwood Mac proud. Haim’s latest single is a song about trying your best and still disappointing those around you.</p>

  	<p>Frequent collaborator Rostam Batmanglij is back, most presently in the bridge where he pans the vocals back and forth across the stereo spectrum. “If I go right / And you go left / Hey, I know we'll meet up again.” Otherwise this track sticks to Haim’s winning formula of low-production pop-rock. With a simple drum line and some infectious strumming, the trio of sisters voices their dismay in a feel-good anthem for anyone who is just trying their best. “Every time I think that I am taking the steps / you end up at mad at me for making a mess.” </p>
