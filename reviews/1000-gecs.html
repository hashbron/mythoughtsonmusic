    <h1>1000 gecs</h1>
    <h2>100 gecs</h2>
    </div> 
      <p>A singular “gec” is a reference to a wise-cracking gecko character from a 90s video game franchise. 100 gecs is the musical duo consisting of Dylan Brady and Laura Les. <i>1000</i> gecs is the name of their latest album of infectious, caustic, genre-bending hyperpop.</p>

      <p>Their style is as confusing as it is eclectic. Songs range from cohesive and conceptual to absurd and disparate. On “Ringtone” the duo evokes Soldier Boy with a bouncy pop number about a cellular crush. “My boy’s got his own ringtone / It’s the only one I know / It’s the only one I answer,” Les bops to interspersed dial tones. Her voice is auto-tuned somewhere between grating and delightful. Then on the confusingly named “I Need Help Immediately” and the equally confusing “gecgecgec” the duo rifs with sounds, loops, and random audio samples as if they are tweens playing with Garageband for the first time.</p>

      <p>Their formula is a lack of formula, with each offering exploring new sounds, trying new combinations, and stretching norms of genre and production to their extremes. “Stupid Horse” sounds like dupstepped ska with a Crazy Frog feature (thankfully it’s just Brady and Les). On “Money Machine” a twangy synth melody unifies disparate lyrical rifs, beginning with the memorable “Hey little piss baby, you think you’re so fucking cool.” Most songs end with a drunkenly overproduced cacophony of electronic screamo. The album progresses with an infectious sense of intensity, buoyed by the rough industrial production. It comes as no surprise that Brady co-produced the alluringly chaotic “Click” from the latest Charli XCX album.</p>

      <p>The duo’s work reaches its zenith on “Hand Crushed by a Mallet” which zigzags between dubstep-adjacent bass drops and auto-tuned musings on romance. The song cycles through rave ready choruses as quickly as it does genres. “I was trying to find / a way to kill time / now you’re gone and I can’t / ever say goodbye,” Brady muses over glittery electronic pulses. “This feeling’s going through my head I’m thinking things I shouldn’t say” he riffs as the song builds to the inevitable bass drop. After the drop, the bass heavy beat is interrupted with synthy crescendos and techno pulses. The song is hectic and exhausting, but intoxicating and exhilarating nonetheless. Finally, the duo settles on a trap-like high hat for its final rumination “You just copy everything we do / If I wasn't me I'd copy me too.” Ironic for a group who’s entire sound is a copy-cat meta-blending of exhausting aesthetics.</p>

      <p>The trite lyrics are self-aware in their banality. More than a commentary on contemporary romance they’re a meta-commentary on the frivolity of today’s pop love songs. Or maybe they are just catchy and trite? <i>1000 gecs</i> masterfully channels the narrative expanse of today’s internet, constantly trying to out-irony itself all the while verging on sincerity. Where TikTok uses pop songs as the backdrop for internet videos, 100 gecs uses the internet as a backdrop for pop songs. At times <i>1000 gecs</i> sounds angry, other times elated, flippant, or bored, and sometimes all four at once -  which is to say, it sounds like the internet in 2019.</p>

      <p>The collective rage of Twitter trolls and Redditors is violently expressed through caustic lyrics and the intensity of dubstep. “Your arms look so fucking cute they look little cigarettes / I bet I could smoke you / I could roast you / and then you’d love it and you’d text me I love you / and then I’d fucking ghost you!” screams an autotuned gremlin in “Money Machine.” Meanwhile, irony seeking meme-ers can find themselves in the absurd Crazy Frog like melodies and the quippier lines. “Shit I’m already broke and its only 7:45 in the morning” raps an over-caffeinated Brady.</p>

      <p>Even the wholesome cat video types can find themselves. The album’s final offering, “gec 2 Ü,” is a dance-ballad about lost love. Brady’s auto-tuned belts and grainy, digitized raps dance over celestial synths. “You’re sitting all alone / and you call me on the phone / and you say ‘I need love / can you gec to me now?’” he asks, recognizing the loneliness that exists within the internet’s vast chaos. Even in the always-online, everywhere-you-go, dopamine-depleting intensity of the modern digital world Brady and Les make space for a little sentimentality. “Everything’s piling up / but that’s cool / cause at least I got you,” they reflect, albeit before indulging their fastest, craziest synth beat yet.</p>
