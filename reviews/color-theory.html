      <h1>Color Theory</h1>
      <h2>Soccer Mommy</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>The first time I heard the name Soccer Mommy - the stage name of Nashville native Sophie Allison - she was walking on stage to open for Vampire Weekend during their FOTB tour. I stood at the front of the auditorium bobbing along through listless acoustic riffs, waiting eagerly for Ezra to come out and play a slew of songs I already loved. At the time, Soccer Mommy’s opening felt like a never ending slog of ambling acoustics; each song felt anticipatory, building towards something, waiting for someone that never seemed to arrive.</p>

    <p>That listlessness, it turns out, is not a bug but a feature of Soccer Mommy’s sound. She uses that eager sense of waiting as a tool to probe the depths of ‘sad girl’ indie-pop, a distance from which she can parse her sadness without wallowing in it. That distance proves critical for Allison, distinguishing her from a slew of similarly angsty artists.</p>

    <p>Her latests album, <i>Color Theory</i>, embraces that critical distance with a nostalgic tour of adolescent ennui. On the lead single “circle the drain” Allison arrives with a hook that feels like an Avril Lavigne song, quickly pulling the listener in, before drowning them in a swirly dreamscape. Acoustic guitars amble about the record, crescendoing and then disappearing, sometimes buoyed by a steadfast bass drum, and sometimes carried only by Allison’s airy voice. There’s a numbness to the entire album - that critical distance on full display - as Allison sings about her feelings without ever feeling them. Her sadness is never overt. Distorted guitars always seem to wait at the fringe, never becoming the focal point, but brought in occasionally as accents as she does in the opening track “bloodstream.” Likewise, her voice is wispy and longing, always feeling like it’s holding back. Even at its most strained there’s a reluctant timbre to it.</p>

    <p>Lyrically, Allison probes her own depression, touching on angsty themes that are a staple of the ‘sad girl’ genre. (“Happiness is like a firefly on summer free evenings / Feel it slipping through my fingers / But I can’t catch it in my hands.”) Her writing sways with her aimless guitar, pilling up run-on sentences that tediously bleed from one line to the next. The dragging language would seem to undercut any attempt at a message, and at times it does, but when it works, it underscores her ennui, revealing complicated shades of melancholy. On “Royal Screw Up” she laments past mistakes (“My room is a kingdom for the princess of screw-in’ up”) by pushing into the tedium (“and I’ll be the dragon I’ll hold me captive / my world is sinking and I am the captain of it all”) and pushing her play on the word ‘royal’ to its extreme. Her languid singing forces the listener to linger on each thought, as if having them with her for the first time. All the while there’s a subtle tongue-in-cheek knowingness, a comic relief in the simplicity of the words and the drawn out sentences.</p>

    <p>There’s a beautiful escapism to <i>Color Theory</i>, from the melodies to the lyrics to the production. The acoustics melt into synths, bleeding between the fringes of indie rock, bedroom pop, and psychedelia. The album’s strongest offering, “yellow is the color of her eyes,” sounds vaguely like Clairo is covering a Mac DeMarco song - in all the best ways. Allison is able to deliver self flagellating lyrics with a nonchalance, almost a carelessness, that sets her apart. Her sadness is steeped in a jaded acknowledgment that the sad girl indie schtick is tired.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I should’ve sat with Soccer Mommy more as I waited for Vampire Weekend. Her detached reflections ebb and flow, meandering as if lost in thought - a calming counterpart to Ezra’s dense witticisms and jam-band flare. Soccer Mommy’s brooding is no doubt listless and slow, but it’s worth taking the time to bask in.</p>
