      <h1>Oblivion Forever</h1>

    <p>It may be almost a decade old, but Grimes’s hit single <i>Oblivion</i> sounds as chillingly futuristic today as it ever has. The garbled, synthy bass line works wonders as the backing for Grimes’s otherworldly falsetto; the listener is at once drowning under water and flying through the air. On Oblivion Forever that same bass line serves as the backing for Charli XCX’s autotuned declarations of love. Magdalena Bay has pulled the vocals (and the title) from Charli’s quarantine single, <i>forever</i>, and juxtaposed it with Grimes’ iconic track, creating a deliciously psychedelic remix in the process.</p>

	<p>Bay distorts <i>Oblivon’s</i> bass line ever so slightly, adding a danceable bounciness and further highlighting Grimes’s cooing vocals. When Charli first purrs “I will always love you” her voice feels effortlessly at home atop the ethereal beats. While the original version of <i>forever</i> padded Charli’s lyrics with caustic hyperpop, Bay dispenses with this production entirely, isolating Charli’s vocals and surrounding them with a welcome eeriness. The relative timing of the vocal tracks manufactures a call and response between the two artists, with Grimes’s dark aphorisms punctuating Charli’s gush confessions. “I will always love you / I’ll love you forever / even when we’re not together / I’ll see you in a dark night.”</p>

	<p><i>Oblivion</i> is a song about assault, an experience Grimes called “one of the most shattering … of [her life].” <i>forever</i>, meanwhile, is a song about love, everlasting and infallible. Where <i>Oblivion</i> describes an emptiness, a state of total nothingness desired after a horrific encounter, <i>forever</i> embraces the experience of being overcome with emotion. Charli’s permanent espousal of feeling defies physical constraints of time and space “I know in the future / we won’t see each other / but I will always love you.” This contrast, like the remix’s title, <i>Oblivion Forever</i>, is at once contradictory and complimentary. Where Grimes longs for escape, Charli indulges her feelings in the current moment. As Grimes’s subconscious “oohs” flit through the background, they ground Charli’s infatuation in a haunted jadedness. Their artificial back and forth speaks to the complexity of relationships, especially those we have with people who have wronged us.</p>
