      <h2>Charli XCX</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>Charli XCX isn’t spending quarantine baking bread. After headlining a Minecraft concert with 100 gecs and releasing hit singles “Claws” and “Forever” she dropped a full length album, <i>how i’m feeling right now</i>, that was conceived, written, and recorded entirely in quarantine. Given the circumstances, it’s amazing that this album exists (recall that Charli’s previous self-titled album is barely a year old), even more amazing is that so much of this record is so good.</p>

    <p>The album’s title, <i>how i’m feeling right now</i>, is a blunt admission of what follows: a zigzagging, exciting, at times exhausting, tour of how Charli is feeling while quarantined at home amidst a global pandemic. The opening track “pink diamond” is a caustic confession of Charli’s boredom. “I just wanna go real hard,” she repeatedly exclaims over grating synths. In the glittering number “detonate,” she apologizes for ghosting in quarantine (“I’m not tryna be rude / I’m just feelin' confused / My emotions get blue”) and waxes existential about loneliness (“I don't trust myself at all / Why should you trust me?”)</p>

    <p>The record’s subject matter is obvious and often droll, but the message rings universal: Charli catalogues in real time the same actions, ideas, and emotions we’ve all been experiencing in quarantine. Though the album’s practicality gets depressing, its slick production works overtime to make up for it. The strongest number, “anthems,” opens with the candid admission “I’m so bored” and goes on to detail Charli’s daily quarantine habits (“wake up late eat some cereal / try my best to be physical …”) Produced by 100 gecs’ Dylan Brady the track descends into a rocking, hyperpop dance number. (“I want anthems / late nights my friends / New York.”)</p>

    <p>As the rules and norms of the world break down around us, Charli has broken down the norms of music writing and production. While the album was in the works, she tweeted out polls for fans to weigh in on everything from lyrics to album artwork. With physical interaction untenable, Charli has taken to social media to involve fans in her music creation, paradoxically making the process more intimate. Her tweets drip with triviality, but as we live through the end of days, that isn’t such a bad thing.</p>

    <p>From her Minecraft set to her social media presence, Charli has embraced a post-ironic, almost shitposty, new tone during quarantine and, if this album is any indication, is moving permanently in that direction. While the beginning of such a transition was present on her self-titled album, it’s complete on <i>how i’m feeling right now</i>. Charli has eschewed the punk influenced ‘bubble gum base’ of her earlier work and embraced the more thrilling, edgier hyperpop sound, a la 100 gecs. Brady has become a regular collaborator credited with production on a number of songs including “anthems” and “c2.0,” a followup to “click” off of the 2019 self-titled.</p>

    <p><i>how i’m feeling right now</i> is not Charli’s most cohesive work, nor is it her best. At times the record is manic, in other moments it drags, and on occasion its outright confusing. These varying moods no doubt stem from the album’s unorthodox production process, but they’re nonetheless steeped in the mores of quarantine. The less than perfect record is an honest reflection of a less than perfect cultural moment: it drags when it dwells too much on the current state of the things, falters with apprehension about the future, but occasionally excels when it looks forward with excitement and hope.</p>
