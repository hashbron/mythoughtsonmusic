      <h1>Love You For A Long Time</h1>
      <h2>Maggie Rogers</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>“So fucking dainty,” is how Maggie Rogers has described her rise to fame. By now the story seems trite: Pharrell cried after hearing a demo of her song “Alaska” in a masterclass, the video of which went viral, leading to her signing a multi-record deal with Capitol Records. Her debut album <i>Heard it in a Past Life</i> chronicles the tumult of emotions that she experienced in going from English student to rock star overnight.</p>

	 <p>Today, Rogers is out with “Love You For A Long Time,” her first single since <i>Past Life</i>, in what feels like the start of a new chapter. The track itself is a return to form for Rogers. Where <i>Past Life</i> at times felt over-produced and pigeon holed into Billboard friendly sounds, “Love You For A Long Time” returns to the airy, natural inspired sounds of “Alaska.” Gentle coos over a simple high hat are met with a twangy guitar riff as Maggie’s full bodied voice charges ahead, overcome with emotion. (“I feel it in my body, know it my mind / Oh, I / I’m gonna love you for a long time.”) If “Alaska” was a water color of blues and violets, “Love You For A Long Time,” finds Rogers painting in streaks of orange and yellow. It’s all quite infectious and moving, if a little dull.</p>

	 <p>Ostensibly a love letter, the song is vague as to its recipient. There are hints that it’s a significant other (“I keep getting lost deep inside your diamond eyes”) but they play as metaphorical more than literal. There’s a transience to her love, an ephemerality in the simple acoustic guitar and the lyrics. It’s not love forever, it’s for a long time (or “a long long long long time,” as she rambles in the final chorus). It sounds less like Rogers has found a special someone than it sounds like she’s finally put the daintiness of the Pharrell saga behind her, that <i>Past Life</i> is finally in the past. Maybe not forever, but at least for now, Rogers is in love with her fans, with her music, and at long last, with her life.</p>
