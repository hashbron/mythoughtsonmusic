    <p>Double negatives abound in Haim’s latest offering “Now I’m In It.” “We can’t not be friends / Can’t not pretend” declares Danielle Haim over a bubbly reverb beat. She’s “in it” and she “can hear it,” but she “can't feel it.” This idea of contradiction is baked into the song’s DNA. The defiant tenor of the chorus obscures and negates the songs’s real message. This is a banger celebrating regression, an acknowledgment that sometimes getting over him isn’t easy.</p>

    <p>It should come as a surprise to no one that this track was produced by Rostam. The opening cadence is reminiscent of Ra Ra Riot’s “Flowers” and the soft spoken, piano laden bridge easily lives in a Maggie Rogers’ song. Ultimately, the bridge subsides and the reverb beat crescendos into a the final chorus. Haim’s defiant trio of voices returns to declare one last time that they’re back in it, and by then, the listener is too.</p>
