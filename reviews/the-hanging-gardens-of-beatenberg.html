      <h1>The Hanging Gardens of Beatenberg</h1>
      <h2>Beatenberg</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>In my favorite cafe in Oxford a song caught my attention; it had Afro-pop beats and a crooning male voice; it was indie rock but it wasn’t Vampire Weekend. Because Jericho Coffee Traders didn’t have wifi or cell service, I was forced to talk to the cute barista instead of using Shazam. In a fuzzy sweater, smiling as he spoke, the barista told me in an his impeccable Oxbridge accent that song was from a South African band called “Beatenburg.”</p>

    <p>A Cape Town based trio, Beatenberg makes globally inspired, Afro-pop influenced, indie rock. On their major label debut, <i>The Hanging Gardens of Beatenberg</i>, the trio sings of lighthearted mundanity and the trials of young love. </p>

    <P>Sonically, comparisons to Vampire Weekend are unavoidable: Beatenberg brings a world music sound, especially African inspired beats and guitar, to acoustic indie rock, all with a swooning male voice. Lyrically, their work hews to a similar Ivy League aesthetic, singing of romance in hallowed libraries and dropping references to Greek philosophers.</P>

    <P>Their globe trotting, Ivy-league sound, however, offers a warmer, sunnier take on Vampire Weekend’s bildungsroman ennui. <i>Gardens’</i> opening track, “Rafael,” is a tongue-in-cheek reflection on the double edged sword that is being a genius (“Sometimes it feels like heaven / Sometimes it feels like hell.”). Its title is a reference to both tennis genius Rafael Nadal and renaissance painter genius Raphael. On "Ithaca," the trio extols the joys of a college romance, singing of library encounters, Cornell University, and Greek myths. Over an infectious bass line they make the sleepy college town the center of a stirring romance.</P>

    <P>Even in the record’s more somber numbers, there’s a pleasant lightheartedness. In “The Prince of the Hanging Gardens,” a meandering ode to unrequited love, an upbeat kick drum keep things moving along, as the trio strings together references to Amazonian paint pigments, the Bougainvillea climbing plant, and the Xanthus and Yangtze rivers. “Facebook Apologia” finds lead singer Mathew Field confessing his love over a solemn piano harmony. “I dropped out of philosophy / At least I'm more handsome than Socrates,” he quips, making the case for himself.</P>

    <P>Across the album, the band’s use of musical styles is as eclectic as their lyrical allusions. Field noted the range of influences telling <i>GQ</i> they were inspired by everything from “the mundane” to “the sublime” to “proper nouns.” That sense of range comes through as acoustic stummings and techno synths blend seamlessly into West African percussion. The track “Echoes” pairs a poppy base reverb with twangy instrumentals. On “Cape to Rio” the trio mixes syncopated guitars with a delightful piano melody and a funky horn interlude. There’s a shimmery radiance to much of their production, a groovy summery quality that pours out of the African guitars and swelling vocals.</P>

    <P>While their lyrics are dense and their allusions academic, Beatenberg makes space for the whimsical. On “Beauty Like A Tightened Bow,” the album’s most Vampire Weekend-like track, electric guitars dance over a toe tapping drum line, as Field woos a love interest. (“Do you wanna go quickly? / Do you wanna go slow? / Well Helen you know your beauty's like a tightened bow.”) During the bridge, the trio repeats “Like a Tightened Bow” a fanciful 24 times (it sounds almost like Animal Collective but without the postmodern absurdity.)</p>

    <P>On the whole, the album paints a rosy picture of bohemian adolescence, dancing optimistically from South Africa to Greek islands, up to Ithaca, New York and back down to Rio. If the album is creating this carefree, interconnected, world, “Beauty Like A Tightened Bow,” seems to beckon the listener to join it. At the height of the song’s chorus, Field propositions “Do you wanna be reckless? Well, come with me” and this listener certainly wants to.</p>
