      <h1>Block Your Number</h1>
      <h2>Maude Latour</h2>
    </div> 

    <p>Maude Latour sounds so much like Lorde that my brother has taken to asking “Is this actually Lorde or is this that girl who sounds just like her?” The 21 year old artist out of Columbia University has the same growly lower register and penchant for strained uptalk as New Zealand’s biggest pop star. Her latest single opens as yet another Lorde clone but ultimately builds to a dizzying spectacle of glittery hyperpop.</p>

	<p><i>Block Your Number</i> begins with Latour, her voice shallow and hoarse, chronicling a past romance over building synths. As the relationship breaks down, her anxiety spirals (“I guess I was too much for you / Or was I just not enough for you?”) and so to do cascading digital arpeggios. The underlying synths become all but overwhelming before the bass drops into a pop-rock chorus that feels at home in the credits of a Dreamworks film. The second verse returns to Latour’s breathy recounting, this time with a sharper wit (“The irony of “poor connection” as we talk over FaceTime / What a metaphor!”) and an infectious bravado.</p>

	<p>If this all sounds a bit disjointed, you’re not wrong, but you’re missing the point. Latour is lost, romantically at her wits end, she’s distilled the cacophonous world of college relationships into a danceable banger.</p>

	<p>Modern dating is confusing enough without a global pandemic, political upheaval, and an impending climate disaster. Those competing forces are felt in the competing sounds pulling <i>Block Your Number</i> in many different directions. Those competing forces are also catalogued in a Spotify playlist containing Latour’s influences for this song, one she dropped on Instagram to promote the song’s release - how gen-z of her. The playlist includes the disparate likes of Join Mitchell, Avril Lavigne, Vampire Weekend, and 100 gecs.</p>

	<p>While this chaotic number isn’t Latour’s strongest release, it’s perhaps her most poignant to date, tapping into the frustrating chaos of the current moment. Having her finger on this youthful pulse will continue to serve Latour well and is yet another thing she has in common with Lorde - who, of course, also made an appearance on the influences playlist.</p>
